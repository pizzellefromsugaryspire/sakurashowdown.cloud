                    <p>Hey there! So.. yeah. Cosmo isn't with us anymore, and things won't be the same without that wild fairy running the show. But don't slow down now! The next season's already speeding your way! You'll get to jump in on the action once it kicks off by casting your votes, catching the rounds over on the Discord and now on YouTube too! We're taking this thing to every platform we can burn rubber on!</p>
